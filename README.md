## 💡Tips !
🛑 Use option 2 (cloudflare) cuz ngrok gives warning  
🌐 Must Use a URL shortener to make the tracking link look natural.  
⚡ Recommended URL shortners : (https://bitly.com/) , (https://grabify.link/) , (https://t.ly/).  
💀 Phishing link : "Send this link to victim".  
📊 Cloudflare links refresh some times , re run the script then.  
🔄 You can share one link to multiple victims.  
🛑 Use this responsibly – only on your own systems or with permission.  
⚡ Always check the tracking link in ur own browser first before sending to someone, make sure it is working.  
📊 images capture will be in capture_image directory with victims ip and logs will be created also.  
⚡ images will be capture continously untill u close the script or victim close the browser.  
🔄 it will download cloudflare only on first run if not already install.  

## 🤝Follow the Prompts !
1) This script is fully interactive! Just, Run it:  
2) Choose a phishing template (e.g., Birthday Wish, Online Meeting, etc.)  
3) Follow the on-screen instructions.  
4) The script starts Cloudflare Tunnel and generates a phishing link.  
5) Send the link to the target – Camera will capture images every few seconds.  

## ⚙️Troubleshooting

1) `Issue: Flask Not Found?:`  
- install the requirements (step 2 above).  

2) `Issue: Cloudflare link Not Working?:`  
- its due to cloudflare server down sometimes, run script after few time maybe hours...  

3) `Issue: Permission Denied?:`  
- try this command (chmod +x cameraphish.py), then run script.  

4) `Issue: Python3 or pip not found?:`  
- read the requirements.txt file, (cat requirements.txt) or (gedit requirements.txt).  

5) `Issue: No images are being captured?:`  
- Means The victim does not give camera permission, nothing to do with this , try someone else.  

6) `Issue: IPv6 instead of IPv4 in logs?:`  
- it will show ipv6 (2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) if there is no ipv4(192.168.1.100) avalible.
